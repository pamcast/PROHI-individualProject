        ## Aims

        After completing the course the student should be able to:
        - explain basic project management methods
        - be able to account for success factors in Health Informatics projects
        - understand basic methods and tools in the field of data science and machine learning
        - explain process models for data mining projects
        - explain the difference between rule-based methods and machine learning methods
        - apply basic project management methods
        - work in an international multidisciplinary project group
        - independently lead and implement a limited project in health informatics - document the steps in the design of a prototype for a health informatics project
        - apply the steps in a process model for data mining projects
        - apply methods from the field of text mining on different types of health informatics problems
        - explain and argue for their positions regarding the implementation of a health informatics project
        - explain how to work with sensitive health information in a safe and ethical way.

        The project I conducted during the Data Science course was based on a Kaggle dataset containing 11 features, 
        aimed at predicting heart disease. Before performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), I started with 
        data preparation by identifying missing values and renaming features. During the EDA, I used descriptive 
        statistics to answer questions that helped me understand the dataset better. The data was not imbalanced. 
        Then, I performed clustering using K-means and hierarchical clustering. Finally, I applied supervised 
        machine learning models, including Random Forests, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and Logistic 
        Regression, to classify patients with and without cardiovascular disease. The best-performing model was 
        the Decision Tree, which achieved the highest accuracy and F1 score.
